Systems Engineering: Analysis, Requirement and Architecture

The mission of Systems Engineering is to ensure the system under developement considers all stakeholder's perspective to deliver a balanced and optimized product. 

The primary approach of Embark's Systems Engineering effort is to root all analysis in first order principles, augment threshold analysis with existing standards and research, verify analysis by comparing with manual truck driving data, and validate design parameters using the Structured Track Test and Road Validation.
